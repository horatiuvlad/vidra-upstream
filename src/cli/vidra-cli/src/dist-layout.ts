 * Where a build puts what it makes.
 *
 * One rule, no exceptions: **`dist/[channel]` is yours, and the `feed` directory
 * inside it is the server's.** Deliverables are what a person downloads once; a
 * feed directory is what a server serves to apps already installed. Before this
 * they shared `dist/` root, so the DMG sat beside the archives you upload and
 * there was no way to tell by looking.
 *
 * The channel is a directory because it is a directory *remotely* too. Each
 * channel owns its own `bundles.json` and its own `releases.{platform}.json`,
 * which is what removes any need for channel labels inside an index, matching
 * rules, or platform-suffixed channel names.
 *
 * A feed directory mirrors exactly one remote prefix, so publishing is "sync
 * this directory to that URL" rather than a rule about which files to include.
